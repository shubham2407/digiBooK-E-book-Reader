<h1 style="text-align: center;">Java Introduction</h1>
<p>Java is one of the world's most important and widely used computer languages, and it has held this distinction for many years. Unlike some other computer languages whose influence has weared with passage of time, while Java's has grown.</p>
<p>Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and a secure and stable programming language but it is not a pure object-oriented language because it supports primitive data types like int, char etc.</p>
<p>Java is a platform-independent language because it has runtime environment i.e JRE and API. Here platform means a hardware or software environment in which anapplication runs.</p>
<p>Java codes are compiled into byte code or machine-independent code. This byte code is run on JVM (Java Virtual Machine).</p>
<p>The syntax is Java is almost the same as C/C++. But java does not support low-level programming functions like pointers. The codes in Java is always written in the form of Classes and objects.</p>
<p>As of 2020, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, especially for client-server web applications.Its has been estimated that there are around nine million Java developers inside the world.</p>

<h3>Creation of Java</h3>
<p>Java was developed by James Ghosling, Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems Inc. in 1991. It took 18 months to develop the first working version.</p>
<p>The initial name was&nbsp;<strong>Oak</strong>&nbsp;but it was renamed to&nbsp;<strong>Java</strong>&nbsp;in 1995 as OAK was a registered trademark of another Tech company.</p>

<h3>History of Java</h3>
<p>Originally Java was designed for Interactive television, but this technology was very much advanced for the industry of digital cable television at that time. Java history was started with the&nbsp;<strong>Green Team</strong>. The Green Team started a project to develop a language for digital devices such as television. But it works best for internet programming. After some time Java technology was joined by Netscape.</p>
<p>The objective to create Java Programming Language was it should be "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic".</p>
<p>Java was developed in Sun Microsystem by James Ghosling, Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheridan in 1991. It took 18 months to develop the first working version. James Ghosling is also known as the Father of Java.</p>
<p>Initially, Java was called&nbsp;<strong>"Greentalk"</strong>&nbsp;by James Gosling and at that time the file extension was&nbsp;<strong>.gt</strong>.</p>
<p>Later on Oak was developed as a part of the Green Team project. Oak is a symbol for strength and Oak is also a national tree in many countries like the USA, Romania etc.</p>
<p>Oak was renamed as Java in 1995 because Oak was already a trademark by Oak Technologies. Before selecting the Java word the team suggested many names like&nbsp;<strong>dynamic</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>revolutionary</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Silk</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>jolt</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>DNA</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>Java is an island in Indonesia, here the first coffee was produced or we call Java coffee. Java coffee is a type of espresso bean. James gosling chose this name while having coffee near his office.</p>
<p>The word JAVA does not have an acronym. It is just a name.</p>
<p>In 1995 Java was one of the best product by the Time magazine.</p>
