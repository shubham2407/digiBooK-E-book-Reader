<h1 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 1</h1>
<p>Sean</p>
<p>The slurping noise from the woman on her knees a few feet from me makes me clench my jaw. The smell of cigars and sex coats the air, making me wish I didn&rsquo;t have to breathe in the stench.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, right there. Swallow it all,&rdquo; Nick mumbles as the slurping noise grows louder, and he grunts his release.</p>
<p>Fucking hell, this is why I like to work alone. Being in the back of a seedy strip club after hours is making my skin crawl.</p>
<p>One last job. I keep reminding myself why I&rsquo;m here. I&rsquo;m going to have to scrub my body with sandpaper when I leave this place. I&rsquo;ll need a scalding hot shower and might even burn my clothes. God knows what&rsquo;s happened in the very seat I&rsquo;m sitting in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want her next? Maybe she can pull that stick out of your ass.&rdquo; Nick laughs at his own joke as the woman pulls herself to her feet. She stumbles as she gets up, almost falling over in her heels. Who knows what she&rsquo;s on. From how rail thin she is and the glazed look in her sunken eyes, I&rsquo;m guessing something heavy.</p>
<p>She steps towards me like my silence is an invitation, but I stop her in her tracks with a stare. I&rsquo;d rather cut my fucking dick off than let her anywhere near it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, man. Loosen the fuck up,&rdquo; Nick says as he adjusts himself and grabs a beer from the table next to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving in five.&rdquo; I clip my words, making them hard. This meeting was supposed to start twenty minutes ago, and I have shit to do. Okay, maybe not shit to do, but I have somewhere else I want to be.</p>
<div class="ad-container">
<p>Stuck in the back of a strip club, waiting for the boss to show up, is not my idea of a good time. I took this job for one reason: a diversion. I need these guys, and I&rsquo;m on a time crunch. Time that is ticking away and being wasted at this very moment. I normally like to work alone, but this job is paying me enough that I can finally retire. I&rsquo;ll be set for life if everything goes according to plan. If being the operative word.</p>
<p>These guys think we&rsquo;re just robbing a bank, which we are, but I&rsquo;m after something else. A bank job isn&rsquo;t enough to have me hanging up my gun, but my real reason for breaking into the bank will give me the good life. There&rsquo;s a very important deposit box inside that vault, and that&rsquo;s my moneymaker. That box is the real reason I&rsquo;ve hooked up with these clowns, and they&rsquo;re the only way I can get into it with the time I&rsquo;ve got left.</p>
<p>No one needs to know I was ever in there, which is why I need a robbery to go down. I need chaos to help create a diversion while I get what I&rsquo;m really after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay until Heavy gets here,&rdquo; Nick says, like he can make me stay.</p>
<div class="ad-container">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;You forget who asked who to do this job.&rdquo; I start to rise from my chair, like I don&rsquo;t give a shit about the job one way or another. They asked me for my help, but only because I&rsquo;d planted seeds for them to do so. I don&rsquo;t want them to know how much this job means to me. It&rsquo;s better if they think I don&rsquo;t give a shit.</p>
<p>Just then, Heavy walks in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out!&rdquo; he snaps, and the girls who have been roaming around scurry from the room.</p>
<p>Lazily, I drop back down into my chair and wait. Heavy pours himself a drink before making his way over to where Nick and I are sitting, a few more of his crew coming in behind him and joining us.</p>
<p>Heavy is anything but heavy. He&rsquo;s barely five foot, balding, and wears the most God-awful suits I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The only reason he&rsquo;s got himself this little makeshift gang is because it used to be his father&rsquo;s until he passed a few years back.</p>
<p>What was once a decent crew turned into a bunch of lazy fucks who clearly aren&rsquo;t making ends meet. Seeing as they all latched on to the stupid idea of robbing a Federal bank, these idiots are dumber than I thought.</p>
<p>Or maybe Heavy&rsquo;s as crazy as I&rsquo;ve heard he is, and he just doesn&rsquo;t care. Crazy is dangerous and makes for sloppy work. Crazy is hard to understand and not easy to predict. I feel like I&rsquo;ve bitten off more than I can chew with this crew, and I&rsquo;m starting to have second thoughts. My doubts are bubbling to the surface, and I think maybe it&rsquo;s time to call this whole operation off.</p>
<p>Right until Heavy drops a stack of pictures and papers on to the table, making my heart jump into my throat.</p>
<p>I sit perfectly still, trying to appear completely unfazed by what I see. The real reason I want to call off the job. I don&rsquo;t make a single move to indicate I know who the woman is. Her pictures are scattered across the table for all these men to leer at, and I&rsquo;m cool and calm on the outside. On the inside, though, I&rsquo;m losing my shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been known for my control, and for the first time in my life, I feel a crack split in my facade. The mask I so carefully wear starts to slip, and I have to rein myself in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tessa Morgan.&rdquo; Heavy says her name like he bought himself a winning lottery ticket. I should have seen this coming, and maybe I did but I ignored it. I don&rsquo;t even like her name on his lips. She&rsquo;s too sweet and pure for a man like Heavy to even say her name.</p>
<p>When I knew what bank was my target weeks ago, I started digging up every piece of information I could get my hands on. Tessa stood out to me right away but probably not for the same reasons she stood out to Heavy.</p>
<p>I hate her name on his lips; it makes my stomach clench. I&rsquo;ve been watching her for weeks already, and I told myself it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s a part of the job. That&rsquo;s a lie, because I haven&rsquo;t watched anyone else at the bank. Just her. I want to watch her now.</p>
