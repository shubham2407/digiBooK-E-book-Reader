A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out.
Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another, ‘What! You too? I thought I was the only one.
True friendship comes when the silence between two people is comfortable.
Don’t make friends who are comfortable to be with. Make friends who will force you to lever yourself up.
A friend is someone who understands your past, believes in your future, and accepts you just the way you are.
A true friend never gets in your way unless you happen to be going down.
The real test of friendship is can you literally do nothing with the other person? Can you enjoy those moments of life that are utterly simple?
