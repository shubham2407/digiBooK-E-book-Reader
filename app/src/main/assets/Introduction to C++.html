<h1 style="text-align: center;">Introduction to C++</h1>
<p>C++, as we all know is an extension to C language and was developed by&nbsp;<strong>Bjarne stroustrup</strong>&nbsp;at bell labs. C++ is an intermediate level language, as it comprises a confirmation of both high level and low level language features. C++ is a statically typed, free form, multiparadigm, compiled general-purpose language.</p>
<p>C++ is an&nbsp;<strong>Object Oriented Programming language</strong>&nbsp;but is not purely Object Oriented. Its features like&nbsp;<code>Friend</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>Virtual</code>, violate some of the very important OOPS features, rendering this language unworthy of being called completely Object Oriented. Its a middle level language.</p>

<h2>Benefits of C++ over C Language</h2>
<p>The major difference being OOPS concept, C++ is an object oriented language whereas C language is a procedural language. Apart form this there are many other features of C++ which gives this language an upper hand on C laguage.</p>
<p>Following features of C++ makes it a stronger language than C,</p>
<ol class="content">
<li>There is Stronger Type Checking in C++.</li>
<li>All the OOPS features in C++ like Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance etc makes it more worthy and useful for programmers.</li>
<li>C++ supports and allows user defined operators (i.e Operator Overloading) and function overloading is also supported in it.</li>
<li>Exception Handling is there in C++.</li>
<li>The Concept of Virtual functions and also Constructors and Destructors for Objects.</li>
<li>Inline Functions in C++ instead of Macros in C language. Inline functions make complete function body act like Macro, safely.</li>
<li>Variables can be declared anywhere in the program in C++, but must be declared before they are used.</li>
